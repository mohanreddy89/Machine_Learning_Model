# Machine_Learning_Model
# Machine Learning Project

This project implements a simple machine learning model using an inbuilt dataset. The model is trained and evaluated using standard machine learning practices.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
  - `dataset.csv`: The inbuilt dataset.
  
- **models/**: Stores the trained machine learning model.
  - `model.pkl`: Serialized format of the trained model.
  
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebook for data exploration and visualization.
  - `exploration.ipynb`: Code for loading the dataset, visualizing data distributions, and performing initial analyses.
  
- **src/**: Source code for training and evaluation.
  - `train.py`: Implements the training process.
  - `evaluate.py`: Evaluates the performance of the trained model.
  - `utils.py`: Contains utility functions for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
  
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- To train the model, run:
  ```
  python src/train.py
  ```
  
- To evaluate the model, run:
  ```
  python src/evaluate.py
  ```

## Model Performance

The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed results will be available in the evaluation output.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of building, training, and evaluating a machine learning model using a structured approach. Further improvements can be made by experimenting with different algorithms and hyperparameters.
